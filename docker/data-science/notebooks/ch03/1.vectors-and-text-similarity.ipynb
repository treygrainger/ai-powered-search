    "The normalized TF clearly helped, as `doc2` is now ranked the highest, as we would expect. This is mostly because of the dampening effect on number of term occurrences so that each additional term (in `doc1`, which matched `the` and `in` so many times) so that each additional occurrrence contributed less to the feature weight than prior occurrences. Unfortunately, `doc1` is still ranked second highest, so even that wasn't enough to get the better matching `doc3` to the top.\n",
