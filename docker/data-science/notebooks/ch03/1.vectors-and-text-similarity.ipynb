    "Finally our search results make intuitive sense! `doc2` gets the highest score, since it matches the most important words the most, followed by `doc3`, which contains all the words, but not as many times, followed by `doc1`, which only contains an abundance of insignificant words.\n",

    "This TF-IDF calculation is at the heart of many search engine relevance calculations, including the default algorithms - called BM25 - used by both Apache Solr and Elasticsearch. In addition, it is possible to match on much more than just text keywords - modern search engines enable dynamically specifying boosts of fields, terms, and functions, which enables full control over the relevance scoring calculation.\n",
