      "1.851 | What are \"minimalist shoes\"? There are some questions regarding \"minimalist shoes\" on the site. By looking at those with the tag, it seems that the term relates to shoes that have thin soles without much spring to them, and sometimes laces. I assume that's not all there is to it. What is the definition of minimalist shoes, and what are the criteria necessary to meet the definition?\n",
      "1.697 | Should one purchase a smaller water shoe size? Do water shoes (not socks) expand some so when purchasing you should go down a size? I wear 8.5 shoe but water shoes do not come in half sizes so wandering if I should go down to an 8 since the shoe may expand some IN WATER. Nothing worse than to get a size 9 and be in the water to lift my foot up in water and the shoe come off. Please advise. the size 9's I purchased are already a big too big so have ordered an 8.\n",
      "1.687 | How to Tell When Minimal Running Shoes Are Worn Out? How can I tell when my minimal running shoes go bad? Let me explain. Conventional Wisdom The conventional wisdom of marathon runners is that running shoes will eventually 'go bad'. That is, at some point the shoes will still work fine for walking around the house and working in the garden, but they have \"lost their bounce\". At some point (roughly 400 miles) your standard pair of, say, Nike running shoes will start to feel like the soles are made of concrete. Standard running shoes lose their bounce. What about minimal running shoes? I am training for another marathon in a pair of minimal running shoes (New Balance Minimus). And I know I have run 600 or 700 miles in this one pair of shoes. But minimal running shoes have no \"bounce\" to start off with. Just super thin soles. So... does that mean I can run in them until they have holes in the soles? Do minimal running shoes 'go bad' too? Or do they work just fine until they're holey?\n",
      "1.676 | Climbing barefoot/in toe-shoes? I recently went bouldering for the first time and liked it a lot. One thing I wondered about are the climbing shoes. The mostly form your feet to a very firm, compact package. So the following question came up in my mind: Why don´t climbers embrace the power of their toes? Why can´t I find anybody climbing barefoot or in (toe-)socks or shoes like Vibrams fivefingers? Would it be worth a try or can I be sure it doesn´t work as well as climbing shoes? _ Of course, you would need to train your feet to get the strength you need. But considering the amount of training climbers put into their hands and fingers for things like \"one-finger-holes\" I think this is probably no good reason for not trying it with your feet... I am primarily interested in indoor bouldering, but aspects for other types of climbing are welcome as well. I am aware that most gyms probably don´t want you to climb barefoot for hygienic reasons... Some background: Here whatsitsname describes for him climbing barefoot and in vibrams didn´t work well. This question is about the use of vibrams five-finger shoes. This closed question is about a specific five-finger model for climbing...\n",
      "1.672 | B2 boots for narrow feet I'm looking to get some B2 boots, but am having difficulty getting a good fit. I tried Scarpa Manta's but my heel kept lifting. I think the issue is that my ankles are quite narrow. Does anyone have any good advice for getting better fitting boots or is it just a case of trying a range of brands? Are some brands known to make narrower boots?\n",
      "1.652 | Where to buy running shoe sole replacements? I've got a comfy pair of runners that I primarily use for walking. I've put them through the wash a few times and they come out spotless. The only ware is on sole, which appears to be 1/2 cm thick or so rubber grip, glued onto the bottom of the shoe. I'm trying to find somewhere that sells this kind of thing but only find inner sole replacements. Suggestions please?\n",
      "1.64 | When I do and when I don't need shoes with ankle supports? There has been a lot of lot of discussion about whether the shoes should have ankle support or not. I have seen the discussions (not just on The Great Outdoors, but elsewhere too) that ankle muscles do not work much and hence leads to weakening of the ankle muscles. The other perspective to this boils down to the point where we would also need to consider the amount of weight being carried. And, surprisingly, its not the just the newbies or the rookies debate about, but its a very very common topic for conflicting opinions among the veterans as well. What all factor should one consider while deciding upon preferring shoes with ankle support and without them?\n",
      "1.624 | Is it unhealthy to wear minimal footwear? A couple of friends and I have taken up hiking here in South Africa and they're pretty geared up with their ankle guards, and extreme hiking shoes and what not. They've got their hiking underwear and whatever else they feel they need. I've always always been opposed to heavy bulky shoes, and always wear minimal stuff. Heck I even said a prayer after ZemGear shut down their operation, so sad so sad. I hike fine with my minimal footwear. I'm extremely light on my feet, so my toes do not bump into anything, and I tread lightly with quite a bit of agility, so I move like a ninja. The only thing is, my feet are pounding after a hike. As in muscle-pounding. It's like when you do too many wrist-curls, but on my feet. Personally this is a feeling I welcome, and love. And my feet heal within a couple of hours after the hike, so it doesn't bother me. But is it unhealthy in the long-run? (I promise, I did not intend that pun.) EDIT: As requested, I don't hike with just my sneakers or anything. I specifically purchased a thick-soled aqua sock so that I could enjoy the many waterfalls we encounter on our hikes.\n",
      "1.614 | How to clean trail running shoes? I've asked all of my trail running friends and the general consensus is to simply hose them off in the sink (some even just wear them in the shower...). I'm concerned that leaving soaking wet shoes just near the radiator will impact the longevity of the shoe. It also means I then can't wear them for a couple of days because they are wet. What is an actual, proper care routine for my trail-running shoes? They are Brooks Cascades if that matters.\n",
      "1.612 | How can I tell a “trail shoe” from a regular sport shoe? On a day-to-day basis, I wear regular light-weight sport shoes, such as these: The footwear I saw people using in serious terrain in the USA looked similar, but this answer to my related question points out those are trail shoes. The concept of trail shoes is new to me, and I have not seen people hiking in those prior to my recent US trip, or I mistook them for sport shoes. How can I tell apart a trail shoe from a regular light sport shoe? Searching Google for trail shoes links either to running shoes or to shoes no different from the ones above. Presumably, they are different from the ones above, that I wouldn't want to wear even for a 2-hour hike in the English countryside, let alone for a mountain trail (I tried exactly once and I've rarely had such painful feet, so either my shoes are different, or I am different). Do people get trail shoes from cottage industry manufacturers or are they sold in regular stores (just hard to distinguish from sport shoes)? I suppose it depends on aspects like Gore-Tex™, Vibram™ soles, protection against rocks, etc., but perhaps there is more.\n"

       "\n",
       "<h3>Overview</h3>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Hiking footwear is designed to provide support, comfort, and protection during outdoor activities. While some individuals may opt for regular walking shoes, specialized hiking boots or shoes offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of durability, traction, and ankle support.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h3>Key Features to Look For</h3>\n",
       "\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Comfort and Fit</strong>: A proper fit is crucial. Hiking shoes should accommodate your foot shape, including considerations for width and arch support. For those with larger or wider feet, finding boots that offer a good fit can be challenging, but it's important to prioritize comfort to avoid issues like swelling or pain during hikes [3].</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: Many hikers prefer waterproof footwear, especially for wet conditions. Waterproof hiking shoes can keep your feet dry during light rain, which is beneficial for comfort and health [4]. However, it's important to balance waterproofing with breathability, as overly insulated shoes can lead to discomfort in warmer conditions.</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Ankle Support</strong>: For rough terrains, ankle support is vital to prevent injuries. Proper lacing techniques can help secure the foot within the boot, reducing the risk of movement that could lead to sprains or fractures [5]. It's recommended to lace boots in a way that provides both comfort and stability, ensuring that the foot does not shift excessively during movement.</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Traction and Durability</strong>: Hiking shoes should have a good grip to handle various surfaces, from rocky paths to muddy trails. The materials used in the soles can significantly affect traction and durability, making it essential to choose boots that are designed for the specific terrain you plan to hike [2].</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Weight</strong>: Lightweight options are often preferred for long hikes, as they reduce fatigue. However, heavier boots may offer more protection and support, which can be beneficial in challenging conditions [3].</p></li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Choosing the ideal footwear for hikes involves considering factors such as comfort, waterproofing, ankle support, traction, and weight. While specialized hiking boots provide numerous benefits over regular shoes, it's essential to find a pair that fits well and meets your specific hiking needs. By focusing on these key features, you can enhance your hiking experience and ensure your feet remain comfortable and protected throughout your adventures.</p>\n",

Are there any real benefits to using specially made boots?</li><li><b>What to look for in hiking shoes?</b>(None)<br>My friends and I are going on our first hiking expedition through Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and I was wondering what type of shoes are recommended by experienced hikers? I have looked up information online, but it seems all I get is advertisements saying \"THIS shoe is meant for hiking! Best price, best quality!\", which isn't very credible. What kind of shoes do you wear? What do you look for in good hiking shoes (i.e. comfort, wide-toe, etc)?</li><li><b>Affordable Hiking/Trekking boots for flat feet</b>(None)<br>I have been using a pair of lightweight desert combat boots for hiking for the past couple of years, but they are finally falling apart and the brand/model has been discontinued. I am a large guy with size 15 feet, typically requiring an EE pair of boots. Very few of the boots I've found are available in my size (Amazon's sizing tool helps a ton), affordable, or known to be good boots (too few reviews). They need to be fairly waterproof, good for standard eastern woodlands terrain, and not be too heavy. What qualities/materials would be best in a pair of boots for someone with large, wide, and flat feet? Update: In choosing between breathability and waterproofness, I'd prefer waterproofness. For example, I've heard things like heel cup construction is important with wider boots so if true a reference example of that quality would be helpful.</li><li><b>Is it ok to wear hiking shoes on street conditions?</b>(None)<br>I want to buy some comfortable shoes to wear while going to work. I have to walk 4 km every day. I want to use these shoes on rainy (not too heavy) days too. I am looking for shoes for all weather conditions (except heavy rain and snow) that are comfortable for walking. I have found some shoes but they say \"WaterProof Hiking Shoes\" and I am curious about whether it is OK to wear these kinds of shoes in an office environment or asphalt streets. Do they have any disadvantages on clear surfaces?</li><li><b>How to properly lace hiking boots?</b>(None)<br>When I go on hiking trips, I wear proper boots. However, when I lace them tight, my ankles swell terribly after a few hours and start feeling funny (bending the joint feels like touching a balloon). There is also light pain in the ankles while walking. After I remove the boots, the pain disappears, but the funny feeling doesn't. This is not a problem of ill-fitting boots, it happened with three different models. As far as I can tell, the only reason is the weight of the boot falling on my ankle every time I lift my leg for a step (probably connected with my gait). I tried lacing them loose, and even leaving the low ankle hooks out. But this is a problem on rough terrain. When I am jumping down boulder rivers, or moving along an eroded karst face stepping on 5 cm wide ledges, I need lots of precision, and have to be absolutely sure that my foot won't move within the boot after I have landed on it, changing my balance. Also, ankle support is required on such trails, as a wrong landing with ankle bending can result in a complicated fracture which can't heal without loss of movement in the joint. My normal lacing procedure (I learned it from a professional hiking guide) is to place the foot on the heel, the angle between the backside of the calf and the floor around 75°, the angle between tibia and sole at 90°. Then slightly tighten the laces in front, run the laces through the ankle hooks, then run them through the two hooks on the shaft and pull them to close the shoe, then knot. The boot feels OK this way, it isn't too tight and doesn't pinch. It feels as good as my sneakers, in which I can walk kilometers without any problems. There are no protrusions within the boot, nothing chafes, it is comfortable (and has been like this since day one - my current pair are expensive brand-name boots with memory foam and so on). Any ideas what can I do to avoid the problem while keeping the boot tight enough?</li></ol>"

What are the effective ways, with no weapons, to defend against a large cat? Are there anatomical differences which create vulnerabilities for large cats? Additional notes: The solo backpacking question does not address the specific questions I listed. I talked with a friend who is a surgical vet, and he thought going for thumbs in eyes, and then thumbs on the trachea would be a good first line strategy. This strategy will result in bites but if administered early in an attack, risk is somewhat mitigated. Another friend, who was a special forces member, killed several dogs, but had weapons (in one case just a stick which was used to smash the skull). He is intrigued and researching the matter. I was able to find an article which talked about the anatomical vulnerabilities of dogs, as well as their instincts. But that didn't address cats. I am not looking for hiking advice, I am asking about killing predatory cats with bare hands. In the instance mentioned, it has been released that the victim was able to suffocate the cat. There is no mention of blinding her. I will probably edit this out later, but on my property I have had large cats, and seen them. One paced a neighbor out for his morning jog. I have also had feral dogs, which I and others encountered, and I eliminated.</li><li><b>Reacting to tornado warnings while camping with no buildings nearby</b>(None)<br>This afternoon there was a tornado warning - TAKE SHELTER IN A PERMANENT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY - for the west half of Algonquin Park issued through the usual channels including Twitter . I believe by \"permanent building\" they meant \"not a tent, not a camping trailer, not an RV\". What we would normally call a building, but I guess they wanted to emphasize that whatever you're camping in does not count. Algonquin Park is not what you'd call rich in actual buildings and it's trivially easy to get yourself hours of travel away from one. Just head off away from an access point and however far you've travelled, that's how far you are from the nearest building. Cell phone service is spotty inside, but let's say you have coverage and you're at a campsite, and you get this warning. Or perhaps you have no electronic help but you see a large dark rotating cloud like in this tweet . Everyone says \"go inside\" but if the nearest inside is two days travel away, then what? What do you do? There is no building to get into. Are you safer out on the water? Are you best off just going in the tent to keep dry (figuring that only a tiny stripe will actually get tornadoed, while the whole park will be rained on and have stuff blown around, and while the tent can't protect you from the latter, it can from the former) or is being outside able to see and run of any value? Should you at least pick up your emergency kit (I have a small belt pack I wear both ways on portages with a whistle, a little first aid, a flashlight, some matches etc and usually some food) so that you'll have it with you if everything else blows away? Should you move your canoe? Tidy the campsite? Try to put all your heavy stuff together and maybe tie packs to each other? Take the tent poles out to make the tent less likely to be picked up by wind? What if you're in transit, on a lake or at a portage? Same set of questions I suppose but with less options. Typical Algonquin geography: lots of large coniferous trees, rocky or sandy shores, lakes of various sizes, paths and trails generally leading back at least 50-100 feet from a shore, small clearings and open beaches for campsites, some small islands. Things to keep in mind: if you're in your house and the house next door is destroyed by a tornado, you were very lucky. You have a roof, you possibly have power and water, and you have all the possessions that were inside at the time of the storm. Maybe you have a broken window. But if everything you owned was on the lawn at the time, and has blown away, you have no food, no shelter, no dry clothes etc. And if my canoe has blown away too, I have no way to leave my current location and have to wait for rescue. The severe thunderstorm itself could be as big a problem as an actual tornado. Since more of the park will get the severe storm, high winds, lashing rain, I would feel saving my \"stuff\" was a matter of life and death. Yet I don't actually know how to save my stuff. And I don't know if saving my stuff works against possibly saving myself. I'm beginning to think saving myself is impossible if an actual car-throwing, roof-ripping, house smashing tornado comes through my campsite, in which case battening down the hatches against merely high winds and stuff-ruination becomes a better use of my time. For example, I can't get more than 20 feet away from a tree unless I go out on the water, which is the worst place to go in a lightning storm. Cliffs, caves, overhangs etc are close to nonexistent in Algonquin.</li><li><b>Surfing competitions, no commentators</b>(None)<br>I was just thinking, how great would it be to be able to have a surf spot (live or not live) streamed directly to my PC, with no distracting voice over. I could have it on my desk while I work, look at the surf, hear the waves and the birds, and it would be like a window on an awesome spot! Is there a website that offers a variety of recordings of surf competitions or just a variety of webcams with audio?</li><li><b>Sparrows eating grains strewn on floor but not the grains in a nice bowl</b>(None)<br>Have the good fortune of having sparrows around my house. I feed basmati rice + big bowl of water to sparrows. I sprinkle basmati rice and other grains in the balcony. The sparrows flock once in the morning and another time around the afternoon/early evening and finish the rice and leave. Recently I began putting the rice in a blue bowl so that the rice/grains don't get swept off by the wind etc. Strangely enough the rice in the bowl remains untouched. They are not eating out of the bowl/box but they eat the rice sprinkled around the bowl. My question is : Why aren't they eating out of the clean bowl. Is blue color of the bowl scaring them away?

       "<hr><h4>Showing 10 Results for <em><script>alert('YOLO!')</script></em></h4><ol><li><b>For what it's worth: climbing-tape</b>(None)<br>The other day I used some mysterious, ultra-sticky climbing-tape at my local gym, which got me thinking: How much should I be paying for my tape? Prices for climbing-specific tape seem to be somewhat upward-sticky (econ-pun intended.) I have gloved up with Metolius tape for $4 a role and I have used generic athletic tape for almost half that. I did noticed a difference in their performance, which made me wonder: Is some tape best used for specific situations? When is it best to go with the more expensive, climbing-specific tapes and when and what can I tape with the cheap stuff? What kind of tape is best for gloves that I am going to be using once, and should I spend more on reusable tape-gloves? Is one kind of tape better for fingers? What other tapes are out there that are either super sticky or super cheap?</li><li><b>Tree climbing in distress</b>(None)<br>There seems to be a legend that in a stressful situation (such as, trying to escape a bear, a boar or other large animals), people can climb trees that they normally could not. Not would not, but literally could not. Is this true ? Given the presumed rarity of these situations, and their circumstances, I do not expect an available dataset of such incidents, with reliable conclusions properly mined out of them. I am interested in any informed opinion on this matter. FWIW tigers are reportedly rather clumsy climbers (except for cubs) but it seems to be the case that a tiger will climb a tree when being chased, or when after prey. The site also gives this interesting bit: Despite their incredible muscle power tigers need to enter a tree at a run, being unable to simply pull themselves up in the manner used by leopards. -- \"Lairweb\" -- If the ability to climb trees in humans is enhanced by stress, what are some major contributing factors? (E.g., a better ability to muster energy, willingness to take risks, readines to ignore minor injuries -- scratches etc.) I am also curious about the kind of trees that can be climbed in this way -- e.g., can humans be driven to mast climbing on a tree when in distress, although they ``normally'' cannot climb a mast?</li><li><b>What climbs at Tahquitz were the original definitions of YDS class 5 grades?</b>(None)<br>From what I understand of the history, Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) grades came about when class 5 in the preexisting system was subdivided into 5.0 through 5.9. This was done by Chuck Wilts, Royal Robbins, and Don Wilson, who were members of the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club, as part of Wilts's 1956 guidebook to the Tahquitz Rock area. A particular climb served as the original definition of each decimal point. Wikipedia states that The Trough was the original definition of 5.0, while Open Book defined 5.9. What was the list of ten climbs that defined these grades, and what grades are they considered to be? Related: Please Explain Rock Climbing Grades</li><li><b>Tioga Pass (Yosemite) Day Use Opening Timeline</b>(None)<br>NPS has opened Tioga Pass for through traffic but not for day use recreation. I can't find any historical information about how long after the initial opening it typically opens for day use. Anyone know when I could expect the pass into Yosemite to be open for day-use recreation hiking? Hoping to go the weekend of July 4th roads permitting, but am worried it will still be closed due to the large amount of snowfall they received this year in the sierras.</li><li><b>RIMO III (elevation: 7,233 m, coordinates, 35°22′31″N 77°21′42″E): first ascent date?</b>(None)<br>RIMO III is one the 6 peaks of the Rimo mountain massif, situated in Indian Kashmir. First ascent : 1985, by an Indian/ British expedition led by Harish Kapadia. Can't find the exact date of this event (day/month/year). Anyone out there has this information? Thank you!</li></ol>"
