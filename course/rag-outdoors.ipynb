      "0.851 | What are \"minimalist shoes\"? There are some questions regarding \"minimalist shoes\" on the site. By looking at those with the tag, it seems that the term relates to shoes that have thin soles without much spring to them, and sometimes laces. I assume that's not all there is to it. What is the definition of minimalist shoes, and what are the criteria necessary to meet the definition?\n",
      "0.697 | Should one purchase a smaller water shoe size? Do water shoes (not socks) expand some so when purchasing you should go down a size? I wear 8.5 shoe but water shoes do not come in half sizes so wandering if I should go down to an 8 since the shoe may expand some IN WATER. Nothing worse than to get a size 9 and be in the water to lift my foot up in water and the shoe come off. Please advise. the size 9's I purchased are already a big too big so have ordered an 8.\n",
      "0.687 | How to Tell When Minimal Running Shoes Are Worn Out? How can I tell when my minimal running shoes go bad? Let me explain. Conventional Wisdom The conventional wisdom of marathon runners is that running shoes will eventually 'go bad'. That is, at some point the shoes will still work fine for walking around the house and working in the garden, but they have \"lost their bounce\". At some point (roughly 400 miles) your standard pair of, say, Nike running shoes will start to feel like the soles are made of concrete. Standard running shoes lose their bounce. What about minimal running shoes? I am training for another marathon in a pair of minimal running shoes (New Balance Minimus). And I know I have run 600 or 700 miles in this one pair of shoes. But minimal running shoes have no \"bounce\" to start off with. Just super thin soles. So... does that mean I can run in them until they have holes in the soles? Do minimal running shoes 'go bad' too? Or do they work just fine until they're holey?\n",
      "0.676 | Climbing barefoot/in toe-shoes? I recently went bouldering for the first time and liked it a lot. One thing I wondered about are the climbing shoes. The mostly form your feet to a very firm, compact package. So the following question came up in my mind: Why don´t climbers embrace the power of their toes? Why can´t I find anybody climbing barefoot or in (toe-)socks or shoes like Vibrams fivefingers? Would it be worth a try or can I be sure it doesn´t work as well as climbing shoes? _ Of course, you would need to train your feet to get the strength you need. But considering the amount of training climbers put into their hands and fingers for things like \"one-finger-holes\" I think this is probably no good reason for not trying it with your feet... I am primarily interested in indoor bouldering, but aspects for other types of climbing are welcome as well. I am aware that most gyms probably don´t want you to climb barefoot for hygienic reasons... Some background: Here whatsitsname describes for him climbing barefoot and in vibrams didn´t work well. This question is about the use of vibrams five-finger shoes. This closed question is about a specific five-finger model for climbing...\n",
      "0.672 | B2 boots for narrow feet I'm looking to get some B2 boots, but am having difficulty getting a good fit. I tried Scarpa Manta's but my heel kept lifting. I think the issue is that my ankles are quite narrow. Does anyone have any good advice for getting better fitting boots or is it just a case of trying a range of brands? Are some brands known to make narrower boots?\n",
      "0.652 | Where to buy running shoe sole replacements? I've got a comfy pair of runners that I primarily use for walking. I've put them through the wash a few times and they come out spotless. The only ware is on sole, which appears to be 1/2 cm thick or so rubber grip, glued onto the bottom of the shoe. I'm trying to find somewhere that sells this kind of thing but only find inner sole replacements. Suggestions please?\n",
      "0.64 | When I do and when I don't need shoes with ankle supports? There has been a lot of lot of discussion about whether the shoes should have ankle support or not. I have seen the discussions (not just on The Great Outdoors, but elsewhere too) that ankle muscles do not work much and hence leads to weakening of the ankle muscles. The other perspective to this boils down to the point where we would also need to consider the amount of weight being carried. And, surprisingly, its not the just the newbies or the rookies debate about, but its a very very common topic for conflicting opinions among the veterans as well. What all factor should one consider while deciding upon preferring shoes with ankle support and without them?\n",
      "0.624 | Is it unhealthy to wear minimal footwear? A couple of friends and I have taken up hiking here in South Africa and they're pretty geared up with their ankle guards, and extreme hiking shoes and what not. They've got their hiking underwear and whatever else they feel they need. I've always always been opposed to heavy bulky shoes, and always wear minimal stuff. Heck I even said a prayer after ZemGear shut down their operation, so sad so sad. I hike fine with my minimal footwear. I'm extremely light on my feet, so my toes do not bump into anything, and I tread lightly with quite a bit of agility, so I move like a ninja. The only thing is, my feet are pounding after a hike. As in muscle-pounding. It's like when you do too many wrist-curls, but on my feet. Personally this is a feeling I welcome, and love. And my feet heal within a couple of hours after the hike, so it doesn't bother me. But is it unhealthy in the long-run? (I promise, I did not intend that pun.) EDIT: As requested, I don't hike with just my sneakers or anything. I specifically purchased a thick-soled aqua sock so that I could enjoy the many waterfalls we encounter on our hikes.\n",
      "0.614 | How to clean trail running shoes? I've asked all of my trail running friends and the general consensus is to simply hose them off in the sink (some even just wear them in the shower...). I'm concerned that leaving soaking wet shoes just near the radiator will impact the longevity of the shoe. It also means I then can't wear them for a couple of days because they are wet. What is an actual, proper care routine for my trail-running shoes? They are Brooks Cascades if that matters.\n",
      "0.612 | How can I tell a “trail shoe” from a regular sport shoe? On a day-to-day basis, I wear regular light-weight sport shoes, such as these: The footwear I saw people using in serious terrain in the USA looked similar, but this answer to my related question points out those are trail shoes. The concept of trail shoes is new to me, and I have not seen people hiking in those prior to my recent US trip, or I mistook them for sport shoes. How can I tell apart a trail shoe from a regular light sport shoe? Searching Google for trail shoes links either to running shoes or to shoes no different from the ones above. Presumably, they are different from the ones above, that I wouldn't want to wear even for a 2-hour hike in the English countryside, let alone for a mountain trail (I tried exactly once and I've rarely had such painful feet, so either my shoes are different, or I am different). Do people get trail shoes from cottage industry manufacturers or are they sold in regular stores (just hard to distinguish from sport shoes)? I suppose it depends on aspects like Gore-Tex™, Vibram™ soles, protection against rocks, etc., but perhaps there is more.\n"

This is not a problem of ill-fitting boots, it happened with three different models. As far as I can tell, the only reason is the weight of the boot falling on my ankle every time I lift my leg for a step (probably connected with my gait). I tried lacing them loose, and even leaving the low ankle hooks out. But this is a problem on rough terrain. When I am jumping down boulder rivers, or moving along an eroded karst face stepping on 5 cm wide ledges, I need lots of precision, and have to be absolutely sure that my foot won't move within the boot after I have landed on it, changing my balance. Also, ankle support is required on such trails, as a wrong landing with ankle bending can result in a complicated fracture which can't heal without loss of movement in the joint. My normal lacing procedure (I learned it from a professional hiking guide) is to place the foot on the heel, the angle between the backside of the calf and the floor around 75°, the angle between tibia and sole at 90°. Then slightly tighten the laces in front, run the laces through the ankle hooks, then run them through the two hooks on the shaft and pull them to close the shoe, then knot. The boot feels OK this way, it isn't too tight and doesn't pinch. It feels as good as my sneakers, in which I can walk kilometers without any problems. There are no protrusions within the boot, nothing chafes, it is comfortable (and has been like this since day one - my current pair are expensive brand-name boots with memory foam and so on).

Hiking shoes and boots are designed with features that enhance comfort, support, and protection compared to regular walking shoes.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h3>Key Features to Look For:</h3>\n",
       "\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Comfort and Fit</strong>: A good hiking shoe should fit well, providing enough room in the toe box while ensuring that the heel is secure to prevent slipping. Many hikers recommend looking for shoes that accommodate wider feet, especially for those with flat feet or larger sizes [3]. Comfort is paramount, as you may be on your feet for extended periods.</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Support and Stability</strong>: Hiking boots typically offer more ankle support than regular shoes, which is crucial for navigating rough terrains. Proper lacing techniques can help maintain this support without causing discomfort, such as swelling or pain in the ankles [5]. It's important to find a balance between tightness for stability and comfort to avoid issues during hikes.</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Waterproofing and Breathability</strong>: Depending on the conditions you expect to encounter, waterproof shoes can be beneficial, especially in wet environments. However, some hikers prefer breathable materials to prevent overheating. If you prioritize waterproofness, ensure that the shoes are designed for it, as this can affect comfort during hikes [3].</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Terrain Suitability</strong>: The type of terrain you plan to hike on should influence your choice of footwear. For example, lightweight boots may be suitable for flat trails, while more robust options are necessary for rocky or uneven surfaces. Experienced hikers often recommend specific features based on the terrain, such as traction patterns on the soles for grip [2].</p></li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Versatility</strong>: Some hikers wonder if hiking shoes can be worn in urban settings or for daily activities. While they can be comfortable for walking, they may not always be suitable for office environments due to their rugged design [4]. It's worth considering how you plan to use the shoes beyond hiking.</p></li>\n",

       "<p>The ideal footwear for hikes primarily depends on the terrain, weather conditions, and individual foot characteristics. Hiking boots are designed to offer better ankle support, durability, and waterproofing compared to regular walking shoes, which can be beneficial for rough terrains and extended hikes [1][2]. When choosing hiking shoes, key factors to consider include comfort, fit (especially for wide or flat feet), waterproofness, breathability, and appropriate sole traction. For example, individuals with large, wide, and flat feet may prioritize waterproof boots with heel cup construction to accommodate their foot shape and provide stability [3].</p>\n",

I talked with a friend who is a surgical vet, and he thought going for thumbs in eyes, and then thumbs on the trachea would be a good first line strategy. This strategy will result in bites but if administered early in an attack, risk is somewhat mitigated. Another friend, who was a special forces member, killed several dogs, but had weapons (in one case just a stick which was used to smash the skull). He is intrigued and researching the matter. I was able to find an article which talked about the anatomical vulnerabilities of dogs, as well as their instincts. But that didn't address cats. I am not looking for hiking advice, I am asking about killing predatory cats with bare hands. In the instance mentioned, it has been released that the victim was able to suffocate the cat. There is no mention of blinding her. I will probably edit this out later, but on my property I have had large cats, and seen them. One paced a neighbor out for his morning jog. I have also had feral dogs, which I and others encountered, and I eliminated.</li><li><b>Reacting to tornado warnings while camping with no buildings nearby</b>(None)<br>This afternoon there was a tornado warning - TAKE SHELTER IN A PERMANENT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY - for the west half of Algonquin Park issued through the usual channels including Twitter . I believe by \"permanent building\" they meant \"not a tent, not a camping trailer, not an RV\". What we would normally call a building, but I guess they wanted to emphasize that whatever you're camping in does not count. Algonquin Park is not what you'd call rich in actual buildings and it's trivially easy to get yourself hours of travel away from one. Just head off away from an access point and however far you've travelled, that's how far you are from the nearest building. Cell phone service is spotty inside, but let's say you have coverage and you're at a campsite, and you get this warning. Or perhaps you have no electronic help but you see a large dark rotating cloud like in this tweet . Everyone says \"go inside\" but if the nearest inside is two days travel away, then what? What do you do? There is no building to get into. Are you safer out on the water? Are you best off just going in the tent to keep dry (figuring that only a tiny stripe will actually get tornadoed, while the whole park will be rained on and have stuff blown around, and while the tent can't protect you from the latter, it can from the former) or is being outside able to see and run of any value? Should you at least pick up your emergency kit (I have a small belt pack I wear both ways on portages with a whistle, a little first aid, a flashlight, some matches etc and usually some food) so that you'll have it with you if everything else blows away? Should you move your canoe? Tidy the campsite? Try to put all your heavy stuff together and maybe tie packs to each other? Take the tent poles out to make the tent less likely to be picked up by wind? What if you're in transit, on a lake or at a portage? Same set of questions I suppose but with less options. Typical Algonquin geography: lots of large coniferous trees, rocky or sandy shores, lakes of various sizes, paths and trails generally leading back at least 50-100 feet from a shore, small clearings and open beaches for campsites, some small islands. Things to keep in mind: if you're in your house and the house next door is destroyed by a tornado, you were very lucky. You have a roof, you possibly have power and water, and you have all the possessions that were inside at the time of the storm. Maybe you have a broken window. But if everything you owned was on the lawn at the time, and has blown away, you have no food, no shelter, no dry clothes etc. And if my canoe has blown away too, I have no way to leave my current location and have to wait for rescue. The severe thunderstorm itself could be as big a problem as an actual tornado. Since more of the park will get the severe storm, high winds, lashing rain, I would feel saving my \"stuff\" was a matter of life and death. Yet I don't actually know how to save my stuff. And I don't know if saving my stuff works against possibly saving myself. I'm beginning to think saving myself is impossible if an actual car-throwing, roof-ripping, house smashing tornado comes through my campsite, in which case battening down the hatches against merely high winds and stuff-ruination becomes a better use of my time. For example, I can't get more than 20 feet away from a tree unless I go out on the water, which is the worst place to go in a lightning storm. Cliffs, caves, overhangs etc are close to nonexistent in Algonquin.</li><li><b>Surfing competitions, no commentators</b>(None)<br>I was just thinking, how great would it be to be able to have a surf spot (live or not live) streamed directly to my PC, with no distracting voice over. I could have it on my desk while I work, look at the surf, hear the waves and the birds, and it would be like a window on an awesome spot! Is there a website that offers a variety of recordings of surf competitions or just a variety of webcams with audio?</li><li><b>Sparrows eating grains strewn on floor but not the grains in a nice bowl</b>(None)<br>Have the good fortune of having sparrows around my house. I feed basmati rice + big bowl of water to sparrows. I sprinkle basmati rice and other grains in the balcony. The sparrows flock once in the morning and another time around the afternoon/early evening and finish the rice and leave. Recently I began putting the rice in a blue bowl so that the rice/grains don't get swept off by the wind etc. Strangely enough the rice in the bowl remains untouched. They are not eating out of the bowl/box but they eat the rice sprinkled around the bowl. My question is : Why aren't they eating out of the clean bowl. Is blue color of the bowl scaring them away? Will try to add pictures later on.</li><li><b>How to introduce individuals to the concept of Leave No Trace</b>(None)<br>How do I prioritize teaching about the concept of Leave No Trace to someone who is unfamiliar with it, without coming across as off-putting because there are so many rules?</li></ol>"
