    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker compose up elasticsearch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the Elasticsearch logs:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker compose logs elasticsearch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make sure the port mapping is correct in docker-compose.yml:\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   ports:\n",
    "     - 9201:9200\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "5. Try accessing Elasticsearch directly in your browser: http://localhost:9201"
